    Allow creating ``/etc/hosts`` on all hosts when Ansible facts are not
    gathered for all hosts. The IP address for a host in ``/etc/hosts``
    may be hard-coded by setting ``etc_hosts_api_address`` in the inventory
    for each host, and when there are no facts available for a host,
    the FQDN and short hostname are generated from the Ansible
    magic-variables ``inventory_hostname`` and ``inventory_hostname_short``.
